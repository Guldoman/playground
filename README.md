# Lite XL Playground

This repository contains files needed to run Lite XL in the browser.
Lite XL includes a shell file that does the job pretty well,
but the aim here is to improve the experience more by making it actually
useful.

You will need to use Emscripten 3.1.57. Older versions may not work.
